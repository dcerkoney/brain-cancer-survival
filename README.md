## Goal

Analyze the data of cancer survivors and treatments in the United States to assist in making decisions related to research and drug development by pharmaceutical companies.
Analyzing this information can guide healthcare providers (oncologists) in deciding on treatment to administer to patients.
It may also help patients have access to the types of treatment that worked for survivors with similar characteristics.
Predictors may include cancer types and stages, age, gender, race, ethnic group, lifestyle, and background.

## Proposed tools

Multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression.

## Data source

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.
