## Background and Objectives

The aim of this project is to study factors contributing to the survival of cancer patients in the US.
To that end, we used Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze all brain tumor cases in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results ([SEER](https://seer.cancer.gov/)) database from 2000â€“2020.
Data cleaning and pre-processing and the train-test split were performed using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), while the [lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library was used to fit the survival models.

## Results

[Here](reports/slides.pdf) are some slides describing the project.
Finally, here are some examples of predicted survival functions adjusted for year of diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression, respectively:
